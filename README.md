# Breakout-Genius
In this project, we will Learn the basics of ML and DL, implement CNN and RL on simple environment, develop a deep RL model to play Breakout game, experiment with hyperparameters and architectures.
<pre>
Week 1-2	Installing dependencies and Jupyter notebook, and learning basics of ML, Deep Learning.<br>
Week 3-4	Learning CNN and implementing it with Pytorch.<br>
Week 5-6	Learning concepts of Reinforcement learning.<br>
Week 7-8	Implementation and training of deep RL model.<br>
</pre>
